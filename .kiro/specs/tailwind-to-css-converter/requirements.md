# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a web application that converts Tailwind CSS classes to their equivalent CSS code. The application will provide a simple interface where users can input Tailwind classes and receive the compiled CSS output in real-time. This tool will help developers understand what CSS is generated from their Tailwind classes and can be useful for debugging, learning, or migrating away from Tailwind.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input Tailwind CSS classes and see the equivalent CSS output, so that I can understand what styles are being applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters Tailwind classes in the input field THEN the system SHALL display the equivalent CSS in the output field
2. WHEN a user modifies the Tailwind classes THEN the system SHALL update the CSS output in real-time
3. WHEN a user enters invalid Tailwind classes THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and show appropriate feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean side-by-side interface for input and output, so that I can easily compare Tailwind classes with their CSS equivalents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display two panels side by side
2. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the input panel SHALL be on the left and output panel SHALL be on the right
3. WHEN the input field is focused THEN the system SHALL allow editing of Tailwind classes
4. WHEN viewing the output field THEN the system SHALL prevent editing and display formatted CSS

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CSS output to be properly formatted and readable, so that I can easily understand the generated styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS is generated THEN the system SHALL format it with proper indentation and line breaks
2. WHEN multiple Tailwind classes are provided THEN the system SHALL combine them into a single CSS rule
3. WHEN the output is displayed THEN the system SHALL use syntax highlighting for better readability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle common Tailwind utilities correctly, so that I can convert the classes I use most frequently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN basic utility classes are entered (padding, margin, colors, etc.) THEN the system SHALL convert them accurately
2. WHEN responsive classes are entered THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate media queries
3. WHEN pseudo-class variants are entered THEN the system SHALL generate the correct CSS selectors
4. WHEN custom values are used THEN the system SHALL handle arbitrary value syntax correctly
